# React Native Shopping Cart

This project is a simple React Native application demonstrating a shopping cart interface. Users can add items to a cart, adjust quantities, remove items, and view a running total. The app also supports selecting items for bulk actions like deletion.

## Features

- **Add to Cart**: Tap the "+" button next to each item to add it to the cart.
- **Remove from Cart**: Tap the "-" button to decrease the quantity of an item in the cart. If the quantity reaches zero, the item is automatically removed from the cart.
- **Item Selection**: Tap the circle next to each item to toggle its selection. Selected items can be bulk deleted.
- **Delete Selected Items**: Use the trash icon in the header to remove all selected items from the cart.
- **View Total**: The footer displays the total price, accounting for any discounts and quantities.
